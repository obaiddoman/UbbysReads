Andy Weir didn’t set out to be a literary giant — he was a computer programmer who started posting his fiction online for free. Which, honestly, feels exactly right once you’ve read his work. His writing is nerdy in the best way: heavy on science, light on ego, and always driven by a sense of practical problem-solving. He's not trying to dazzle you with metaphors. He just really wants to explain how oxygenators work — and somehow, you end up caring.

Weir self-published The Martian in 2011, and it blew up — partly because it was smart, partly because it was funny, but mostly because it made surviving on Mars feel like a group project you might be able to pass if you had enough duct tape and sarcasm. Since then, he’s written Artemis (a lunar heist story) and Project Hail Mary (a cosmic buddy comedy with stakes as high as the sun). His books always orbit science, but they land in something deeply human: resilience, loneliness, hope, bad coffee.

He’s not here to write lyrical prose. He’s here to solve problems. And somehow, that makes his stories feel weirdly comforting — like the universe might be hard, but at least it's figure-out-able.

I’d already seen the movie — Matt Damon, Mars, potatoes — you know the one. But people kept saying the book was funnier. That it was “funny but smart,” and not in that annoying “Marvel quip” kind of way. So I gave it a shot, and honestly? They were right.

What I didn’t expect was how much sarcasm one man could produce while dying slowly on a red rock 140 million miles from Earth. Mark Watney is like if Bill Nye and a Reddit troll had a baby — and somehow, that combo works.

“I’m going to have to science the shit out of this.”
Legendary.

But for all the jokes, this book doesn’t shy away from loneliness. The isolation sneaks in, not in dramatic sobbing monologues, but in small cracks between Watney’s humor. You start to feel the silence of Mars. The routines. The way even optimism starts to echo after a while.

What amazed me was how real it felt. The science — which could’ve been dry — actually made it better. Like, I genuinely learned things. About rovers. And how oxygen works. And yeah… potatoes.
It somehow made soil and duct tape feel like plot twists.

And yet, the most moving part? It wasn’t Watney himself. It was everyone else. The people on Earth who refused to leave one guy behind. The engineers, scientists, and mission control staff who bent the rules and re-ran the numbers and cared. There was something unexpectedly beautiful about watching a planet try to save a person.
(Not gonna lie though — I don’t think my world’s organizing a rescue mission if I get stuck on a rock somewhere. Just saying.)

Genre-wise, this is science fiction, but not the spaceship-dogfight-laser kind. This is real-world sci-fi, grounded, nerdy, stubbornly hopeful. Like Apollo 13 but with more swearing and better snacks (or at least more inventive ones).

And yeah — a sarcastic botanist becomes a symbol of survival. Somehow that feels very 21st century. A guy with the power of duct tape, math, and sheer stubbornness keeps going. Not because he's fearless, but because giving up would be boring.

Would I recommend it?
Yes — especially to people who think they hate sci-fi. Because this book isn’t really about Mars. It’s about one human doing everything he can to not die — and making us laugh while he does it.

And somehow, that’s enough.
