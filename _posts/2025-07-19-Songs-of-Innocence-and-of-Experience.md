**William Blake (1757–1827)** was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work was largely unrecognized in his lifetime but has since become central to English literature and art. A visionary from an early age, Blake claimed to see angels in trees and speak with spirits — experiences that shaped a body of work marked by spiritual intensity, radical politics, and formal innovation.

He trained as an engraver, and much of his poetry was self-published in “illuminated” books — works in which text and image were etched, printed, and colored by hand. His best-known collections, _Songs of Innocence_ (1789) and _Songs of Experience_ (1794), explore the tensions between purity and corruption, nature and society, childlike faith and institutional power.

Though often considered part of the Romantic movement, Blake defies easy categorization. His writing is at once mystical and grounded, deeply personal and fiercely political. He distrusted authority, both religious and governmental, and imagined a world where the human spirit might be free to create, love, and rebel.

Today, Blake is seen as one of the most original and influential figures in English literature — a poet who spoke not to his age but to the ages to come.

 I went into this with zero expectations. I’d heard of Blake, obviously — the Romantic mystic guy with strange symbols and angels and maybe some madness — but _Songs of Experience_ was my first real encounter with him. What caught me off guard was how quiet and sharp the whole thing is. There’s no grand shouting, no theatrical lament — just this slow, calm disillusionment that sneaks up on you and stays.

The contrast between _Innocence_ and _Experience_ is where the power lives. You start with the gentle glow of childhood, faith, trust, softness — and then _Experience_ enters like a sudden fog. Not cold, not loud — just there. It’s like Blake’s telling you: “See? You thought you understood the world.” And then he turns it, just a little, and now nothing is simple anymore.

Some parts felt too distant, too abstract, and I’ll admit a few poems didn’t land for me. But then you get to ones like _A Dream_, _Holy Thursday_, _The Little Girl Lost_, _The Little Girl Found_, _The Little Vagabond_, and _The Schoolboy_ — and they just _work_. They’re sad without being sentimental, critical without being bitter. Especially _The Little Vagabond_ — that voice, that raw honesty. It sticks.

The tone in _Songs of Experience_ isn’t angry, but there’s tension underneath. You feel how much Blake sees — corruption, hypocrisy, systems pretending to be salvation. It’s not a total rejection of belief, but a confrontation with the way the world poisons it. Especially in poems like _Holy Thursday_, where the “innocence” of children is framed against institutional cruelty. Blake doesn’t say “these are bad people” — he says, “Look. Just _look_.” And somehow that’s worse.

I didn’t see the illustrations, just read the poems plain. But even without the visuals, there’s an illuminated quality to it — not in the sense of enlightenment, but in how Blake seems to be writing _from_ somewhere else. Not above us, not outside — just adjacent. Like he’s caught between earth and dream, reporting back.

And now I’m curious. I want to try _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, maybe even one of his prophetic works — though I hear they’re dense. But I get the feeling that if _Songs of Experience_ found a way into me, then somewhere down the line, those wilder works might too.

Blake’s not easy. Not always clear. But there’s something oddly honest in that. Experience isn’t tidy. Neither is he.

> **HOLY THURSDAY**
> 
Is this a holy thing to see
   In a rich and fruitful land,—
Babes reduced to misery,
   Fed with cold and usurous hand?
Is that trembling cry a song?
   Can it be a song of joy?
And so many children poor?
   It is a land of poverty!
And their sun does never shine,
   And their fields are bleak and bare,
And their ways are filled with thorns,
   It is eternal winter there.
For where’er the sun does shine,
   And where’er the rain does fall,
Babe can never hunger there,
   Nor poverty the mind appal.”
   
  >**THE SCHOOLBOY**
  >
I love to rise in a summer morn,
   When the birds sing on every tree;
The distant huntsman winds his horn,
   And the skylark sings with me:
   O what sweet company!
But to go to school in a summer morn,—
   O it drives all joy away!
Under a cruel eye outworn,
   The little ones spend the day
   In sighing and dismay.
Ah then at times I drooping sit,
   And spend many an anxious hour;
Nor in my book can I take delight,
   Nor sit in learning’s bower,
   Worn through with the dreary shower.”
“How can the bird that is born for joy
   Sit in a cage and sing?
How can a child, when fears annoy,
   But droop his tender wing,
   And forget his youthful spring!
O father and mother if buds are nipped,
   And blossoms blown away;
And if the tender plants are stripped
   Of their joy in the springing day,
   By sorrow and care’s dismay,—
How shall the summer arise in joy,
   Or the summer fruits appear?
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,
   Or bless the mellowing year,
   When the blasts of winter appear?”
