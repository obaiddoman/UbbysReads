Before sci-fi was even called sci-fi, there was H.G. Wells. Writing in the late 1800s, he somehow imagined things we’re still writing about now — aliens, time travel, genetic engineering, invisible men. But his books aren’t just about the tech. They’re about what happens when people are given power they don’t understand — or worse, power they do.

Wells was trained in biology, and it shows. His stories often have that cold, surgical lens — like he’s holding up the human condition with tweezers and asking, “What is this made of?” But there’s also something deeply emotional under the surface: fear, loneliness, awe. He doesn’t moralize. He just builds the machine and lets it run.

Moreau, the Time Machine, the War of the Worlds — all his stories are different kinds of warnings. Not just about science, but about us. Our ambition. Our cruelty. Our fear of becoming what we already are.

He’s not the warmest writer. But he might be one of the clearest mirrors we’ve ever held up to ourselves.

I stumbled across this while browsing H.G. Wells’ lesser-known stuff — short story, weird title, and a couple of dramatic reviews that made it sound like a lost gem of oceanic terror. I was in the mood for something brief and unsettling, and I was curious how Wells would handle horror, not just sci-fi.

Also… giant squid attacking people?
Yeah, okay. Let’s see.

So here's what I’ll say: it starts promising. The tone is cold, clinical, almost detached — like someone’s calmly describing a horrible event they definitely watched from a safe distance. People are strolling along the coast. Something moves in the water.
Then things get weird. Fast.
Squid. Screaming. Dragged under.
And Wells doesn’t explain anything. No origin. No reason. Just chaos erupting from the sea.

But the thing is…
It didn’t really go well with me.
(hehe — you see what I did there.)

It’s one of those stories that starts with curiosity, veers sharply into terror, and then… just ends. No real arc. Just a shrug of a final line, like:
“Well, that happened.”

And look — I get what it was going for. There’s something eerie about not knowing. About being small. About nature rising up without warning or reason.

“Nature fighting back — or just reminding us we’re not in charge.”
That part? That stuck with me.

But did I find any beauty in it?
Nope. Just nope.
There was too much yapping. Too much wandering and long paragraphs and names I forgot halfway through. It felt like the horror was being filtered through a very polite newspaper editor who wanted to make sure you knew which direction the tide was going.

Would I recommend it?
Only if you’re okay with stories that don’t explain themselves.
It’s short, it’s weird, and if you're into creature horror with zero handholding, maybe it’s your thing.

Me? I closed it and immediately went looking for something with a little more meaning — or at least a little less squid.
