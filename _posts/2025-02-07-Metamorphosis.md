Franz Kafka (1883–1924) was a German-speaking writer from Prague, known for his haunting, often surreal stories about alienation, anxiety, and the absurdity of modern life. Though he published only a few works in his lifetime, his unique voice and dreamlike, unsettling style left a lasting impact on world literature. He’s best known for The Metamorphosis, The Trial, and The Castle — all of which explore characters trapped in bizarre, often unexplainable realities.

Today, “Kafkaesque” is a word we use to describe situations that feel illogical, oppressive, and quietly terrifying — the way his stories often do.

 The Metamorphosis

I didn’t expect to feel so much after reading The Metamorphosis. I thought it would be strange, maybe even cold — a man wakes up as a bug, people avoid him, and that’s it. But it got under my skin in a way I wasn’t ready for.

What stood out to me wasn’t the transformation itself, but how normal it felt. Kafka doesn’t dramatize Gregor turning into a bug — it just happens. Quietly. Without explanation. And somehow, that made it feel more real. Like the kind of change no one notices until it’s too late.

Reading it felt like sitting in Gregor’s room. I could feel the stillness, the silence. The way his family moved on around him, not out of cruelty at first, but out of fatigue. He became a burden. And then a background object. It made me think about how quickly someone can disappear — how easy it is to stop seeing someone, even when they’re right in front of you.

It was reflective for me. I didn’t cry, but I felt something heavy settle inside me. I started thinking about what we owe to each other — not just love, but attention. Presence. Understanding.

I don’t know exactly what The Metamorphosis is about. Maybe that’s the point. It resists answers. It’s part dream, part slow-motion tragedy. But if I had to try, I’d say it’s about what happens when someone stops being who we expect them to be — and how we often fail to meet them where they are.

This wasn’t just a story about a man turning into a bug. It was about someone becoming unrecognizable to everyone around him — and then to himself.

And that feels… familiar.
