Raymond E. Feist (born 1945) is an American fantasy writer best known for his _Riftwar Saga_, beginning with _Magician: Apprentice_ (1982). Drawing on the traditions of high fantasy established by Tolkien yet marked by a brisk, accessible style, Feist’s work helped define the epic fantasy of the late twentieth century. His novels combine the coming-of-age narrative with expansive world-building, political intrigue, and interdimensional conflict. Over four decades, Feist has created one of the most extensive shared universes in modern fantasy, spanning multiple continents, generations, and worlds.

didn’t pick this up because I knew what it was. I just stumbled on it in a local bookstore, turned it over, read the back, and realized it was a fantasy novel. And that surprised me, because I’d never read fantasy before — not once. I wasn’t sure what I was getting into, but something about it made me curious enough to try.

At first, it moved slowly. Feist spends a lot of time setting up the world — introducing people, names, kingdoms, bits of lore that don’t seem important yet. But then it suddenly opens up. The pace quickens, the story expands, and what began as a quiet apprenticeship in a castle turns into something much bigger — a war, a clash of worlds, a story about destiny. For a book written in the early eighties, it’s surprisingly fast-paced and cinematic. It has this momentum that feels modern even when the dialogue or descriptions show its age.

The core of the story, though, is Pug. His journey — from a shy orphan learning magic to someone caught in forces far beyond his control — gives the book its emotional anchor. He’s not a complicated character, but he feels real enough that you want to see him succeed. His friendship with Tomas, and how their paths slowly diverge, adds a quiet layer of emotion that balances the larger, more epic parts of the story.

Feist’s writing style is clear and readable — not ornate, not flowery, but often better than it’s given credit for. Every now and then, there’s a line or image that lands beautifully, something that gives a hint of poetry beneath the simplicity. It’s obvious he loves the world he’s creating. You can feel the care he puts into its geography, its history, and the little human details that make it believable.

The sense of scale is what really stood out to me. As the story grows, it becomes less about one boy’s fate and more about the weight of the entire world around him. It’s the kind of story that reminds you why people get so attached to long fantasy series — because the world itself becomes something you don’t want to leave.

The characters are mostly archetypal — the mentor, the prince, the loyal friend — but they still work. There’s something comforting about how straightforward they are. Even when I could predict what was coming, I still wanted to follow them through it.

By the time I finished, I wasn’t ready to let it go. I wanted to pick up _Magician: Master_ right away. For something I found by chance, with no expectations at all, it turned into one of those books that quietly pulls you in and stays with you.

It’s not perfect — it shows its age, and it’s not the most nuanced writing out there — but it has heart, imagination, and a sense of wonder that feels rare. For a first fantasy read, it was a great entry point. It reminded me how powerful it can be to step into a world completely unknown and just let it take over.
