**Mahmoud Darwish** (1941–2008) was a Palestinian poet, essayist, and one of the most important literary voices of the Arab world. Exiled from his homeland at a young age, Darwish spent much of his life writing about **identity, loss, exile, and resistance**, weaving together the personal and the political with lyrical intensity.

Often referred to as the **poet of Palestine**, his work transcends geography, speaking to anyone who has ever felt dislocated, silenced, or misunderstood. His poems, though rooted in a particular history, resonate with universal longing and defiance. Whether mournful or fierce, Darwish’s writing is always deeply human.

> Put it on record. I am an Arab…

The first time I read this poem, I felt like someone had slammed a hand on the table and dared the world to listen. It's not subtle. It's not soft. It's a declaration. But beneath the fire and fury, there’s something even louder — grief.

Darwish’s _Identity Card_ isn’t just about being Palestinian. It’s about what happens when the world tries to erase you, reduce you to paperwork and borders and suspicion. He responds not with an apology, but a reclaiming. “I am an Arab.” Not a question. Not a whisper. A line in bold.

What struck me most wasn’t just the anger, though there’s plenty of that. It was the exhaustion beneath it. The kind of tired that builds up over generations. The kind that doesn’t come from fighting — but from having to _prove you exist_ over and over again.

And the poem does what all good resistance art does: it refuses simplification. It holds the reader still and says, look at me. You don’t get to look away. Not this time.

> _Write it down!  
> I am an Arab  
> You have stolen the orchards of my ancestors..._

> _And you left nothing for us  
> Except for these rocks.  
> So will the State take them too,  
> As is being said?_

> _You may take my food, my house,  
> my chair, the rugs,  
> the walls of the house,  
> my ancestors’ relics...  
> But I will not compromise._

ou don’t need to be Palestinian to feel it. You just need to understand what it means to want dignity and to be denied it.

If you’ve ever felt erased, ignored, profiled, misunderstood — this poem is for you.
