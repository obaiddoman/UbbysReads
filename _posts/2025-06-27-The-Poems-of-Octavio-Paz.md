Octavio Paz was a Mexican poet, essayist, and diplomat, widely regarded as one of the most influential literary voices of the 20th century. His poetry, spanning surrealism, metaphysics, eroticism, and history, explores the inner life of the self while situating it within broader cultural, philosophical, and political contexts. Paz fused modernist experimentation with deep roots in Mexican and Mesoamerican thought, drawing on influences from both Eastern mysticism and Western tradition.

Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, he is celebrated for his visionary imagery, intellectual rigor, and spiritual restlessness. In English, his work is often presented in bilingual editions, thanks in large part to the elegant translations and editorial framing of Eliot Weinberger, who helped make Paz’s complex, luminous poetry accessible to a wider audience.

This was my first time reading Octavio Paz — and a few pages in, I already knew it wouldn’t be the last. This collection spans 65 years of his poetry, chosen and arranged to give something close to a full picture, though Paz never really feels like someone you can "get a full picture" of. He writes like he’s standing just slightly out of reach — and that’s part of the draw.

It’s hard to write about poetry. Not because there’s nothing to say, but because so much of it is feeling, and once you start trying to explain feeling, it slips away. But what I can say is that the structure of his poems — physically, on the page — really added something. The shape of the poem becomes part of how it breathes. Line breaks feel like footsteps or stumbles. Silence becomes a rhythm.

Even in translation, there’s movement. The language flows in a way that feels inevitable and mysterious at the same time — like you're hearing something ancient but personal. You don’t always “understand” every word, but somehow, it still makes sense. That eerie, half-lit clarity is what I loved most.

> “I am the shadow my words cast.”  
> Still echoing.

There are moments where metaphor stretches long — across centuries, mythologies, states of being. A poem about a body becomes a city becomes a sky. A single word becomes a question. And history is never far off — colonialism, language, the architecture of silence. You feel time pressing in, but the voice stays light, precise, deliberate.

This collection felt like a good introduction. It opens a door into Paz’s world without trying to tame it. I marked lines not because I understood them fully, but because I felt them moving. I’ll come back to this one — maybe not all at once, but slowly, whenever I need a poem that doesn't rush to be understood.


> “I am the shadow my words cast.”

> “To read a poem is to hear it with our eyes; to hear it is to see it with our ears.”

> “A tree grew.  
> The tree is no longer there.  
> Now I can hear it.”

> “I don't want to go on being a root in the dark...  
> I want the light of the sea,  
> the true kiss of the wave,  
> a soul of salt and blood.”

> “Time is born each time I blink.”

> “Between what I see and what I say,  
> between what I say and what I keep silent,  
> between what I keep silent and what I dream,  
> between what I dream and what I forget:  
> poetry.”
