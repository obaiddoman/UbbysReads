George Orwell (1903–1950) was a British novelist, journalist, and political thinker best known for his novels 1984 and Animal Farm. His writing focused on truth, freedom, surveillance, and the abuse of power. With clear, direct language and sharp insight, Orwell explored how governments can manipulate language and control thought — ideas that still resonate today.

“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”

I know, I’m a bit late to this one — another one of those books that somehow exists in the background of everyone’s cultural awareness, even if they’ve never touched a page. I kept hearing about how short it was, how brutal, how perfectly Orwellian (literally), and I thought: okay, let’s see what all the bleak fuss is about.

Honestly? The idea of animals starting a revolution sounded kind of charming in a twisted fable sort of way. I went in expecting something symbolic but digestible. What I got was darker than I expected — subtle, sharp, and too close to reality for comfort.

At first, it felt like satire. The animals rise up, throw off their chains (well, harnesses), and establish their own version of equality. There’s a brief moment — a paragraph or two — where it almost feels hopeful. Then the cracks start to show. The pigs become more fluent in manipulation. The rules begin to bend. The rest of the animals, loyal and illiterate, just keep working harder. By the time you realize how far things have gone, it’s too late — for them and for you.

What struck me most was the slow shift in language. How quiet the horror was. The commandments changing ever so slightly. The slogans getting shorter, more simplified — until all that’s left is blind allegiance.

“Napoleon is always right.”

That line still chills me, not because it’s loud, but because of how quietly it fits into the animals’ minds.

And then there’s Boxer. Poor Boxer. Loyal, strong, tragically trusting. His fate hurt more than I expected — not in a tearjerker way, but in a “you knew this was coming, and it still stings” way.

“I will work harder.”
“Napoleon is always right.”
The saddest mantra ever written.

Orwell doesn’t waste words. The simplicity is the point — the story strips down grand political ideas until what’s left is power, raw and inevitable. It’s not about pigs and horses and windmills. It’s about how easy it is to lose sight of the truth when you’re tired, afraid, and hopeful all at once. It’s about how revolutions rot from the inside when no one remembers to ask questions.

There’s beauty in how Orwell holds back. He never spells things out, never says “this is Stalin” or “this is propaganda.” But you feel it. You see it. And it clicks.

“The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again;
but already it was impossible to say which was which.”

That final line is devastating. Not loud, not flashy — just matter-of-fact. And somehow that makes it worse.

Would I recommend it? Definitely. It’s short, sure, but it hits hard — not in a dramatic gut-punch kind of way, but in a slow, creeping way that lingers long after you put it down. It's not meant to entertain. It’s meant to wake something up.

And it does.
