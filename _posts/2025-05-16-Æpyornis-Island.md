Before sci-fi was even called sci-fi, there was H.G. Wells. Writing in the late 1800s, he somehow imagined things we’re still writing about now — aliens, time travel, genetic engineering, invisible men. But his books aren’t just about the tech. They’re about what happens when people are given power they don’t understand — or worse, power they do.

Wells was trained in biology, and it shows. His stories often have that cold, surgical lens — like he’s holding up the human condition with tweezers and asking, “What is this made of?” But there’s also something deeply emotional under the surface: fear, loneliness, awe. He doesn’t moralize. He just builds the machine and lets it run.

Moreau, the Time Machine, the War of the Worlds — all his stories are different kinds of warnings. Not just about science, but about us. Our ambition. Our cruelty. Our fear of becoming what we already are.

He’s not the warmest writer. But he might be one of the clearest mirrors we’ve ever held up to ourselves.

This one didn’t do much for me. I picked it up expecting something strange and maybe a little eerie — a man alone on an island with a prehistoric bird? Sounds like it could be weirdly brilliant.  
But honestly? It felt flat.

The idea is great on paper: a giant extinct bird hatches from an egg and becomes the only company a stranded man has. But instead of tension or awe or even absurd comedy, the story mostly drifts. The man survives. The bird grows. They stare at each other a lot.  
It’s not bad — just… kind of there.

Wells can be sharp and unsettling (_The Sea Raiders_ still lingers), but this one felt more like a sketch than a story. The tone stays too dry for the premise. I didn’t feel creeped out, or moved, or even particularly curious. It ended, and I just sort of shrugged.

Would I recommend it?  
Maybe — if you’re reading through Wells’ short fiction as a collection. But if you’re just looking for something memorable, I’d skip this and go find the mollusks eating people instead.  
Now _that_ one sticks with you.
