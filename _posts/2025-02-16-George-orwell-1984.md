George Orwell (1903–1950) was a British novelist, journalist, and political thinker best known for his novels 1984 and Animal Farm. His writing focused on truth, freedom, surveillance, and the abuse of power. With clear, direct language and sharp insight, Orwell explored how governments can manipulate language and control thought — ideas that still resonate today.

1984

’ve always heard 1984 described as one of the most important dystopian novels ever written — and now that I’ve read it, I understand why. I picked it up not just to check a classic off my list, but because I genuinely wanted to know: how does totalitarianism really affect the mind? What does it do to a person when the truth is no longer fixed, and when surveillance becomes a normal part of daily life?

I also read it to compare it to the world we live in now — and that’s where it hit hardest. Because some of it doesn’t feel dystopian at all. It feels familiar.

The constant surveillance in the novel — the sense that someone is always watching — isn’t some far-fetched fantasy. We live with cameras, algorithms, data collection, and digital footprints. And the rewriting of history? It actually happens. Facts get blurred, deleted, reframed — and suddenly, what’s remembered isn’t what really happened.

One moment in the book that shook me was when Winston finally says “2 + 2 = 5.” Not because he’s tricked — but because his mind has been broken. He doesn’t resist anymore. And by the end, when he says he loves Big Brother, I felt this deep, quiet dread. That even love — the most personal thing — isn’t safe under that kind of power.

What stayed with me most is the idea that truth can be rewritten — not just in newspapers, but in someone’s mind. That reality isn’t what’s real, but what authority says is real.

And that’s terrifying.

I won’t say I “enjoyed” reading 1984. It’s a difficult book. Cold, bleak, and emotionally heavy. But it’s necessary. It opens your eyes to things you thought were only possible in fiction — until you start noticing echoes of them around you.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. But only if you’re ready to be uncomfortable — and ready to question the world you’re in.

Because 1984 isn’t just a novel about the future.  
It’s a mirror — and parts of it reflect today.
