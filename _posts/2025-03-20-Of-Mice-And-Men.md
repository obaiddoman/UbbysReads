John Steinbeck (1902–1968) was an American novelist and Nobel Prize winner best known for his portrayals of working-class life during the Great Depression. With a spare, compassionate style, he wrote about hope, poverty, dignity, and disillusionment. His most famous works include The Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, and Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck’s fiction often finds quiet tragedy in ordinary lives — and unexpected beauty in human resilience.

Back in 8th grade, my teacher picked this book for me. I remember opening it once or twice but not really connecting with it. I wasn’t interested. It felt like one of those stories adults insisted was important — the kind you’re supposed to read but don’t feel anything from yet.

Then one day, years later, I stumbled onto a clip on TikTok — a quiet scene, Lennie, George, a riverbank. Just that. And something about it stayed with me. So I gave it another shot. This time, it stuck.

What hit me first was how gentle the book was — even though it’s full of tension. The way the characters talk. The way they hope. The way things fall apart slowly, not all at once. It’s a short book, but everything inside it feels heavy, like dust you can’t shake off.

What stayed with me most wasn’t the ending (even though that’s brutal). It was the loneliness. Every character — George, Lennie, Candy, Curley’s wife, Crooks — they’re all isolated. Even when they’re talking, they’re still alone. No one really gets what they want. No one really belongs.

The most haunting moment for me wasn’t even the final page — it was when Candy realizes what just happened and says: “You done it, didn’t you?” That line? It carries more weight than a whole chapter.

And despite all that — there’s still beauty here. Steinbeck’s writing is so alive. He makes even dry land and silent rooms feel full of breath. He doesn’t try to be poetic. He just is. That’s rare.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. It’s short, honest, and hits harder than most long books. You don’t need to be in the right “literary” mood. You just need to be open to feeling a little wrecked — slowly.

Because sometimes the quietest books leave the loudest echoes.

❝Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world.❞
❝You done it, didn’t you? I s’pose you’re glad.❞
❝A guy needs somebody—to be near him.❞
