Arthur Miller (1915–2005) was one of the foremost American playwrights of the twentieth century, renowned for his unflinching portrayals of the American dream and moral conflict. His masterworks—including Death of a Salesman, The Crucible, and A View from the Bridge—interrogate the intersection of personal responsibility and societal pressure with rare emotional power and dramatic clarity. A chronicler of conscience in the modern age, Miller's legacy endures in the enduring relevance of his work.

By Arthur Miller (Penguin Classics)

I honestly don’t know what made me pick this one up. I think it was the Penguin Classics cover. It looked dramatic, kind of sad, and like it might be one of those books people talk about with seriousness. I had no strong expectations — I just saw it, opened it, and started reading.

And I felt tired. Not from the language or the pacing — but emotionally. From the first few pages, it was like watching someone drown in slow motion.

What really stuck with me was how deeply Willy Loman tied his entire worth to being “well liked.” Like that was his life strategy. Not hard work, not care, not even talent — just being liked. And it wasn’t working. It was never really working. But he couldn’t let that idea go. That was painful to witness.

There’s a moment — probably the most heartbreaking line in the whole play — where Biff says to him, “I’m nothing, Pop. I’m nothing.” And Willy… just doesn’t hear it. Or maybe he does, but he refuses to believe it. He’s too far gone by that point. He’s already out planting seeds in the dark, like literally digging into the dirt behind the house at night, hoping something will grow. I can’t explain how sad that image is. A man trying to leave behind a garden he’ll never see bloom, just so he can prove he mattered.

By the time I got to the ending, I knew what was coming. I mean — it’s Arthur Miller. Of course it was going to end with a quiet collapse. But still, I kept hoping he’d stop. That something would shift. That someone would say something and it would break the cycle. But no. He went through with it.

I didn’t cry. I just sat there for a while after finishing it, feeling like I had aged a little.

If I had to sum it up: this is a story about what happens when you live someone else’s dream — when you chase a version of success that doesn’t actually fit you. And then one day, you look around and realize there’s no one left cheering for you, and nothing left to sell.

Would I recommend it? Yeah. Especially if you’ve ever asked yourself what it means to “make it” — and whether that answer is even yours.

Some lines that haunted me:

“He’s liked, but not—well liked.”

“Nothing’s planted. I don’t have a thing in the ground.”

“I’m nothing, Pop. I’m nothing.”

Arthur Miller didn’t need big explosions or wild twists. Just a kitchen table, a man in his sixties, and a lie too heavy to carry any longer.
