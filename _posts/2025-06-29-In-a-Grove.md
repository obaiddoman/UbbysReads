Ryūnosuke Akutagawa is often called the “father of the Japanese short story.” Writing in the early 20th century, he blended traditional Japanese themes with modernist techniques and psychological insight. His works often explore the ambiguity of truth, human nature, and morality through sharp, sometimes haunting storytelling. _Rashōmon_ (1915) is among his most famous tales — a dark, atmospheric story set in Kyoto that probes the fine line between survival and morality, truth and deception. Its influence extends beyond literature, inspiring Akira Kurosawa’s iconic film _Rashomon_, which expanded on its themes of subjective truth.

>“ If you’re going to take somebody’s woman, a man has to die. When I kill a man, I do it with my sword, but people like you don’t use swords. You gentlemen kill with your power, with your money, and sometimes just with your words: you tell people you’re doing them a favor. True, no blood flows, the man is still alive, but you’ve killed him all the same. I don’t know whose sin is greater—yours or mine. (A sarcastic smile.)”


This might be the best Japanese short story I’ve read so far. Maybe because I started with _Rashōmon_, warmed up to Akutagawa’s tone — that quiet, unsettling tension — and then jumped straight into _In a Grove_. That was the right move. Where _Rashōmon_ hints at moral collapse, _In a Grove_ walks right into it and hands you the broken pieces.

What struck me the most was how Akutagawa doesn’t hand you a clean answer — not even close. He basically throws you a messy, bloodied puzzle and says: “Figure it out yourself.” And the more you try, the more you realize that every piece lies a little. That’s the genius of it.

We get the same event — a murder in the forest — told from different points of view: the bandit, the wife, and the dead husband (through a medium, which adds its own layer of weirdness and brilliance). Each of them tells a completely different story. Not just in detail, but in tone, in blame, in what they leave out. You start spotting all the little contradictions, all the ways they’re shaping the story to suit themselves.

The bandit wants to sound bold and noble, like he won in an honorable duel.  
The wife tries to come off as powerless, ashamed, but pure.  
The dead husband — even from beyond the grave — seems desperate to preserve some scrap of dignity.

They’re all trying to protect something. Their pride. Their guilt. Their image. Maybe even their place in the afterlife.

That last account — the dead husband speaking through the medium — is the one that got to me most. Not just because of the content, but because of the tone shift. The writing suddenly breathes. It turns lyrical, intimate. For a moment, Akutagawa drops the façade of testimony and lets the language open up. It’s a moment of eerie stillness, where emotion leaks through the cracks of all the cold, factual retellings.

>“Ah, what is the life of a human being—a drop of dew, a flash of lightning? This is so sad, so sad. What can I say?"

By the end, nothing’s resolved. There’s no truth — or rather, there are too many versions of it, each shaped by ego, fear, self-justification. It made me think that even when we think we’re being honest, we’re editing ourselves. We can’t help it. Maybe even the ghost has something to hide.

At its peak, the story starts shedding even the need for explanation. Characters seem to speak with just their eyes. It’s not poetic — it’s survival. Justification. A desperate scramble to make sense of their actions, or at least make them _look_ better. And in that scramble, you realize they’re all guilty. And they’re all victims. At once.

That’s the beauty of it — and the ache. Akutagawa leaves you sitting in the grove long after the story ends, staring into the trees, still trying to decide what, if anything, was real.

> “I killed him... but not out of hatred.”

> “I wanted to make myself believe that I had killed him honorably, in a fair duel.”

> “Women cannot be trusted... they are creatures of emotion.”

> “I stabbed myself in the chest with the small sword. When I came to, I was dead.”

> “Who is telling the truth? I don’t know. None of them seem to be lying completely. But none of them tell the whole story.”
