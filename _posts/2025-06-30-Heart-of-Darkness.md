Joseph Conrad (1857–1924) was a Polish-British writer whose work bridges the 19th and 20th centuries, capturing the twilight of the Victorian era and the dawn of modernism. Born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski in what is now Ukraine, he didn’t learn English until his twenties — yet he became one of the language’s most celebrated novelists.

Conrad’s stories often explore the dark corners of the human psyche and the fragile veneer of civilization. His experiences as a merchant seaman infused his writing with vivid maritime detail and a sense of existential drift. His best-known works, including _Heart of Darkness_, delve into colonialism, moral ambiguity, and the thin line between order and chaos.

His prose can be dense and atmospheric, but beneath the surface lies a relentless questioning of truth, power, and the self. Conrad’s influence reaches far beyond literature — his explorations of identity and imperialism continue to resonate today.

> First off, let’s get this straight: _Heart of Darkness_ is one of those classics you pretty much have to read if you want to call yourself well-read.

Yeah, the prose can feel heavy and dense — no surprise when you realize English was actually Conrad’s _third_ language (French was his second). That explains the lyrical, almost hypnotic quality to the writing. Once you get past that style, the story itself becomes much easier to sink into.

Even Conrad seemed unsure about what exactly he was saying. Take these two quotes from the book — they almost contradict each other:

> “The belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.”

and

> “Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn’t touched. I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror—of an intense and hopeless despair... ‘The horror! The horror!’”

It’s a powerful read, obviously steeped in its own historical context — but the heartache is that the horrors Conrad wrote about are still alive today. The Democratic Republic of Congo continues to be exploited, this time for rare earth minerals and diamonds, with some miners digging by hand just to survive.

I’ve heard people call Conrad racist, and yeah, there are moments in the book — the language and attitudes are uncomfortable, to say the least. But honestly, who from that era wasn’t? I don’t think you can call _Heart of Darkness_ a racist book just because it uses racial slurs or reflects its time’s prejudices. It’s dense, layered, and complex — full of metaphorical and almost nautical jargon that makes it a tough read. This was my first Conrad, and I nearly gave up several times. It took me almost a week to finish, and yeah, the tiny font didn’t help. But I’m glad I stuck with it. I’m sure it won’t be my last Conrad.

To understand the book fully, you need some background: from 1885 to 1908, the area now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo was under King Leopold II of Belgium’s brutal rule. Through the Red Rubber system, millions of Congolese were enslaved to harvest rubber. Those who failed quotas had their hands chopped off; others died from disease or were outright murdered. Estimates say between 3 and 13 million people died in that period — up to half the population. Just 100 years before, the Kongo Empire was thriving, and then it was destroyed.

In the novel, black people are described with animalistic traits. Marlow calls them “savages,” refers to them as if they have tails, and focuses on their bodies purely as tools for labor. This dehumanization is obviously part of Conrad’s critique of colonialism — the absurdity and horror of treating humans as mere beasts. But Marlow himself seems trapped in his own paternalistic view: he’s disgusted by colonial cruelty but still sees black people as “less than.” For example, he describes a black overseer as “less black” because he works for the colonizers — a sign that Marlow equates whiteness with power or civility. So, while Marlow opposes colonialism, he’s far from a true ally. His perspective is still steeped in racist assumptions.
