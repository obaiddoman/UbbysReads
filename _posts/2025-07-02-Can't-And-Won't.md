**Lydia Davis** is known for writing some of the shortest stories you'll ever read — and some of the most polarizing. A master of **microfiction**, she blends observation, dry humor, and everyday moments into strange little vignettes. Critics love her. She's won a MacArthur “Genius” Grant. But her work often divides readers: you either sink into her fragmented world or bounce off it completely.

### **ANSWER: _Can’t and Won’t_**

**QUESTION: Will I read another book of "stories" by Lydia Davis?**

You know when you’re scrolling Goodreads, and you see all these people raving about something — 4 stars, 5 stars, calling it _brilliant_ — so you think, _Okay, maybe I’ll keep going_? That was me. I kept reading, waiting for that switch to flip. Spoiler: it never did.

This book… I don’t even know where to start. Pages and pages about cows standing around. Obituaries turned into filler. That _Letter to the Foundation_ piece? Never-ending. I forced myself through more than I wanted to, hoping for some kind of payoff or epiphany — but honestly, I don’t think there’s anything _to_ get.

A friend warned me. Said Davis might not be for me. They were right. Maybe some of her other work hits differently, and I’d still give it a chance someday. But _this_ book? Felt like a chore. I’ve done more interesting things than read this, including staring at my ceiling.

The writing didn’t move me. The stories — if you can even call them that — felt flat, dull, and painfully unoriginal. The book was like a burnt biscuit. No jam, no butter, nothing could save it. And the fluffier it got, the more burned I felt.

I rarely say I _hate_ a book. But here we are. It wasn’t just a bad read — it was lifeless. Wordy in all the wrong ways. Some longer pieces dragged on, and I kept thinking they could’ve been trimmed into a single sentence or scrapped altogether. I don’t even mind wordy or meandering prose when there’s _something_ to hold onto. But this had nothing — the imagery didn’t land, the diction was weak, and most of it felt like placeholders instead of finished thoughts.

Weirdly, the beginning wasn’t terrible. It gave me a sliver of hope. But I didn’t finish. I couldn’t. The disappointment was too real. I usually have a rule: if I buy a book, I finish it. But luckily, I didn’t pay for this one — it was just sitting in my EPUB files. And I’m glad I didn’t waste money on it.

I ain't even leaving her Quotes.
