Ryūnosuke Akutagawa is often called the “father of the Japanese short story.” Writing in the early 20th century, he blended traditional Japanese themes with modernist techniques and psychological insight. His works often explore the ambiguity of truth, human nature, and morality through sharp, sometimes haunting storytelling. _Rashōmon_ (1915) is among his most famous tales — a dark, atmospheric story set in Kyoto that probes the fine line between survival and morality, truth and deception. Its influence extends beyond literature, inspiring Akira Kurosawa’s iconic film _Rashomon_, which expanded on its themes of subjective truth.

> “He had supposed that the change in his nose would make him happy. But instead, he found himself feeling more miserable than ever.”

Read three Akutagawa stories in one night. No regrets. Actually, I think it was one of the best things I’ve done recently. _The Nose_ in particular got under my skin in the most unexpected way.

What started out feeling like a strange little satire — a priest with an absurdly long nose, obsessed with shrinking it — ended up unsettling me more than I care to admit. There’s this quiet moment in the story where Akutagawa talks about how people actually _resent_ others who escape their misfortunes. That hit me. Hard. Not because it was unfamiliar, but because it felt like a mirror held up to something I didn’t want to see.

It wasn’t just recognition — it felt like he was implicating me. That subtle form of ego — the one that wants to feel superior, even in suffering — it’s real. Zenchi Naigu’s unexplained irritation when others laugh at him after his nose is “fixed” became my own discomfort. Akutagawa doesn’t condemn it. He just shows it. And that makes it land all the harder.

> "When at last his nose was shortened, he discovered that he was even more miserable than before."

The brilliance of this story lies in how compact and comical it is — and yet how much weight it carries. Beneath all the nose-wringing and awkward temple gossip, there’s a whole conversation happening about human behavior: our obsession with appearances, the need to control how others see us, the way we pin our worth to things we wish we could hide. The Nose could be anything — our looks, our flaws, our bank accounts, our insecurities — anything we obsess over or judge in others.

Naigu isn’t ruined by his nose. He’s ruined by what people’s laughter does to his ego — before and after the change. He can't accept himself, and when he tries to “fix” things, he only discovers a new layer of self-consciousness. That moment when others begin to mock him _after_ the nose is shortened says it all: even when you think you've freed yourself from judgment, it just takes a new shape.

There’s also something almost cruelly ironic in how Akutagawa sets all this in a Buddhist context. In a tradition that preaches detachment from desire, Naigu becomes completely consumed by one absurd obsession. He loses focus, stumbles through his sutras, forgets the spiritual path entirely — all because of one body part, and the shame attached to it.

The worst part? When he sees someone else with a similar “flaw,” he doesn’t feel empathy. He feels _relief._ That small moment reveals the quiet ego we all carry — the desire to know we’re not alone in our flaws, even if it means someone else is suffering too.

What Akutagawa does so well — not just here but across so many of his stories — is show us these human contradictions without over-explaining or moralizing. He just lays it out. Clean. Unblinking. And it lingers.

> “It was not the nose that tormented him, but the world’s gaze upon it.”

> "He felt the same irritation as when someone laughs at you for something you've worked very hard to change."
