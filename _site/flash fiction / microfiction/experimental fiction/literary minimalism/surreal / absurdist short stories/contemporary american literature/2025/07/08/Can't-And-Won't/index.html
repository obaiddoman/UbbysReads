ANSWER: Can’t and Won’t

QUESTION: Will I read another book of “stories” by Lydia Davis?

You know when you’re scrolling Goodreads, and you see all these people raving about something — 4 stars, 5 stars, calling it brilliant — so you think, Okay, maybe I’ll keep going? That was me. I kept reading, waiting for that switch to flip. Spoiler: it never did.

This book… I don’t even know where to start. Pages and pages about cows standing around. Obituaries turned into filler. That Letter to the Foundation piece? Never-ending. I forced myself through more than I wanted to, hoping for some kind of payoff or epiphany — but honestly, I don’t think there’s anything to get.

A friend warned me. Said Davis might not be for me. They were right. Maybe some of her other work hits differently, and I’d still give it a chance someday. But this book? Felt like a chore. I’ve done more interesting things than read this, including staring at my ceiling.

The writing didn’t move me. The stories — if you can even call them that — felt flat, dull, and painfully unoriginal. The book was like a burnt biscuit. No jam, no butter, nothing could save it. And the fluffier it got, the more burned I felt.

I rarely say I hate a book. But here we are. It wasn’t just a bad read — it was lifeless. Wordy in all the wrong ways. Some longer pieces dragged on, and I kept thinking they could’ve been trimmed into a single sentence or scrapped altogether. I don’t even mind wordy or meandering prose when there’s something to hold onto. But this had nothing — the imagery didn’t land, the diction was weak, and most of it felt like placeholders instead of finished thoughts.

Weirdly, the beginning wasn’t terrible. It gave me a sliver of hope. But I didn’t finish. I couldn’t. The disappointment was too real. I usually have a rule: if I buy a book, I finish it. But luckily, I didn’t pay for this one — it was just sitting in my EPUB files. And I’m glad I didn’t waste money on it.

I ain’t even leaving her Quotes.
